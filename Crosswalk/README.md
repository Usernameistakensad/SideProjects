## Crosswalk

(project created ca. April 2016)

This project was created as a joke after our software development teacher gave us an exercise with a *very* brief description: "Create a crosswalk. Cars should obey traffic law. At least one car has to turn right at the intersection. Usage of external libraries not allowed". That was it. We weren't told whether this was supposed to be a console application / text simulation, a graphical representation or even a game. Me and a few classmates decided to make this application as a joke.
After I finished the basic requirements I began expanding this to be a small game engine, which is why I decided to upload it in the first place.
Since no external libraries were permitted, System.Drawing/GDI+ was my choice for the graphics.
Define the debug flag "INFO" for debug information (FPS, amount of entities etc.) or "TEST" to enable drawing colliders and paths to the screen.
