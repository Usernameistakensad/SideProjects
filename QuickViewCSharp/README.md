## QuickViewCSharp

(project created ca. March 2014)

A minimalistic image viewer that supports animated .gifs and transparency.
One of my earliest projects and thus one of my worst in terms of code quality. 
To open an image, either drag it onto the executable or use the "Open with..." dialog. Once the program is started, press CTRL + H for help.
