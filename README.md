# Side Projects
This repository contains various side-projects of mine that have *not* been polished enough to be published as their own repositories. Most of these programs were created for my own personal use and weren't intended to be released at all.

Please note that the quality of code is going to be significantly lower than my actual projects.

## Projects

[CSGOSquadButton](https://github.com/rakijah/SideProjects/tree/master/CSGOSquadButton) - Adds a button to Steam profile pages to quickly search CSGOSquad.com.  
[Crosswalk](https://github.com/rakijah/SideProjects/tree/master/Crosswalk) - A badly phrased homework excercise done over the top.

[OverwatchFinder](https://github.com/rakijah/SideProjects/tree/master/OverwatchFinder) - A tool that finds The Suspect in Overwatch cases in the game Counter Strike: Global Offensive.  
[QuickViewCSharp](https://github.com/rakijah/SideProjects/tree/master/QuickViewCSharp) - An old UI-less image viewer that I originally built for personal use.
